# ClassicLauncher
Classic Launcher is HTPC front-end for old console emulators with its UI based on nes classic edition menu UI. It's being done on Unreal Engine 5 with c++ with a focus to train my developer skills.

Currently it is already able to open emulators with the rom.

There's still no documentation on how to configure Classic Launcher.

Theme support will be added soon.
